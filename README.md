# SysBot.NET

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPLv3-blue.svg)

## Disclaimer

This is a fork with some new routines that I started working on since Scarlet/Violet (that's also my main focus). I'm working on this project for personal purposes, because I like to develop in my freetime (as a fulltime fullstack .NET developer). While my goal is to develop a working SysBot.NET for everyone, some routines may only work for me. If you run into any issues, just let me know and I'll try to help.

If you don't like my work, that's fine, just don't use it, I guess... ;)

## New routines

These routines are new in comparison to the original SysBot.Net

#### Scarlet/Violet

- Encounters (Ruinous, Loyal Three, Gimmighoul and static/new Paradox' in Area Zero)
- Fast egg hatch (~1,800 eggs/hour)
- Partner Mark (just run circles)
- Reset
  - Bloodmoon Ursaluna (see [Wiki](https://github.com/Eppin/Sysbot.NET/wiki/4.-Encounter-(Bloodmoon-Ursaluna)) for proper setup)
  - Pecharunt (see [Wiki](https://github.com/Eppin/Sysbot.NET/wiki/5.-Encounter-(Pecharunt)) for proper setup)
  - _Probably all other Raid-a-like statics_
- Overworld
  - Scanner, just walk and save
  - Research Station

#### Sword/Shield

- Max Lair (resets for IVs/Nature)
