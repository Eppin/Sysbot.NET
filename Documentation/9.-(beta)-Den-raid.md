# Sword/Shield: Den/Raid Bot (Beta)

This guide explains how to use the Den/Raid bot for Pokémon Sword and Shield. Please note that this feature is currently in **beta**, so it may not be completely stable.

## Modes of Operation

There are two available modes for the Den/Raid bot:

### 1. Wishing Piece Mode

*   **Action**: The bot throws a Wishing Piece into an empty den, then searches for a beam of the desired color. It checks for stop conditions (Nature, Shininess, IVs, and/or Species). If the initial Pokémon doesn't match, the bot will perform day skips to advance the den encounter until a matching Pokémon is found or the maximum advances are reached.
*   **Configuration**: To use this mode, set the `ThrowWishingPiece` option to `true` in your SysBot.NET settings.

### 2. Day Skip Mode

*   **Action**: The bot performs day skips in front of an active den (one that already has a beam) to advance the encounter. It checks each new encounter against your defined stop conditions (Nature, Shininess, IVs, and/or Species) until a match is found or the maximum advances are reached.
*   **Configuration**: To use this mode, set the `ThrowWishingPiece` option to `false` in your SysBot.NET settings.

## Configuration Options

Ensure you properly configure the following options in SysBot.NET for the Den/Raid bot:

*   **`Location`**: Specify the region where the den is located.
    *   Options: `Galar`, `IsleOfArmor`, `CrownTundra`
*   **`PurpleBeam`**: Set to `true` if you are searching for a purple beam (rare den), or `false` for a regular red beam.
*   **`GuaranteedIVs`**: Define the minimum number of guaranteed perfect IVs for the Pokémon you are searching for.
*   **`MaxAdvances`**: Set the maximum number of day skips the bot will perform before stopping if a matching Pokémon is not found.
*   **`SkipDelay`**: This value (in milliseconds) determines the pause between each day skip.
    *   Optimizing this value is crucial. Too low might cause the game to miss day skips. Too high will slow down the process. Experiment to find the optimal delay for your setup.
*   **Stop Conditions**: Configure your desired `Nature`, `Shiny`, `IVs`, and/or `Species` for the bot to target.

## In-Game Setup

1.  **Position**:
    *   **Wishing Piece Mode**: Stand in front of an empty den where you can throw a Wishing Piece.
    *   **Day Skip Mode**: Stand in front of an active den (a den with an existing beam).
2.  **Internet Connection**: Ensure your Nintendo Switch is **not** connected to the internet to prevent unintended online interactions and to allow local day skipping.
3.  **Text Speed**:
    *   **Wishing Piece Mode**: Set in-game text speed to the **Slowest** option.
    *   **Day Skip Mode**: Set in-game text speed to `Fast` for optimal performance.
4.  **Autosave**: Turn `Autosave` **Off**.

## Important Considerations (Beta)

*   **Stability**: As this is a beta feature, you might encounter unexpected behavior or errors.
*   **Effectiveness**: The success rate can vary depending on game version, console performance, and `SkipDelay` timing.
*   **Reporting Issues**: If you encounter problems, find something weird, or suspect a bug, please contact me or create an issue on GitHub with as much detail as possible (your settings, game version, what happened) to help improve the bot.
