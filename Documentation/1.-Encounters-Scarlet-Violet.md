# Scarlet/Violet: Encounter Bot Guide

This guide explains how to use the Encounter bot for Pokémon Scarlet/Violet. The bot can optionally use a 100% capture rate cheat (original source: [GBAtemp](https://gbatemp.net/threads/pokemon-scarlet-violet-cheat-database.621563/)). After a Pokémon is caught, the bot reads Box 1, Slot 1 (B1S1) to check if the encounter matches your defined stop conditions.

## In-Game Settings Prerequisites

Before starting, please configure the following options in your game:
-   'Autosave': **Off**
-   'Send to Boxes': **Automatic**
-   'Give Nicknames': **Off**

## Game Setup Instructions

1.  **Poké Balls**:
    *   Ensure you have only **Master Balls** in your bag's Poké Ball pocket.
    *   Alternatively, if you enable the 100% capture rate cheat, you can use any Poké Ball type you prefer.
2.  **Party and Boxes**: Your party should be full. In your PC, select Box 1 and ensure Slot 1 is empty, as this is where caught Pokémon will be sent.
3.  **Positioning**: Save your game directly in front of the Pokémon you intend to encounter.
4.  **Start the Bot**: Launch SysBot.NET and start the encounter bot.
