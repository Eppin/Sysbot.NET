# Legends: Z-A: Catch Diancie

This guide covers catching Diancie until a `StopCondition` is met (e.g., shiny, specific IVs, etc.).

## Prerequisites

- Have access to Diancie encounter
- Position yourself in front of Diancie

## Setup

1. Stand directly in front of Diancie
2. **Important**: If you start the routine and the battle doesn't begin, take one more step forward
3. Once positioned correctly, **save your game**
4. Start the bot

## Catch Rate Cheat

- If you select **Master Ball**: No cheat needed (100% catch rate)
- If you select **any other ball**: Enable the 100% catch rate cheat

## How It Works

The bot will:
1. Initiate the battle with Diancie
2. Attempt to catch Diancie with your selected ball
3. Check if the caught Diancie matches your stop conditions
4. If not, reset and repeat the process

## Tips

- Make sure you're positioned correctly before starting (battle should start immediately when routine begins)
- Use stop conditions to target specific Diancie (shiny, nature, IVs, etc.)
- Master Ball guarantees a catch without needing cheats
