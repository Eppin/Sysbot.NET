# Scarlet/Violet: Unlimited Egg Mode Guide

The Unlimited Egg Mode for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet automates the breeding process. It will continuously breed Pokémon until an egg matches a specified `StopCondition`. The bot will keep running as long as there are parent Pokémon in the designated folder.

## Setup for Unlimited Egg Mode

1.  **Party Configuration**:
    *   Place a Ditto in **Slot 1** of your party.
    *   Place any other Pokémon in **Slot 2** of your party (this Pokémon will be replaced by the parents from your folder).
2.  **SysBot.NET Settings**:
    *   Set the `ContinueAfterMatch` setting to `Continue`.
    *   Set the `UnlimitedMode` setting to `true`.
    *   Specify the path to your folder containing parent Pokémon in the `UnlimitedParentsFolder` setting.
3.  **In-Game Action**:
    *   Open a Picnic. You can do this anywhere in the game. (Tip: Flying to Area Zero and starting a picnic there can be efficient).
4.  **Start the Bot**:
    *   Launch SysBot.NET and start the egg bot.
    *   The bot will begin by taking the first parent Pokémon from your `UnlimitedParentsFolder` and placing it into **Slot 2** of your party, replacing the Pokémon initially there.
