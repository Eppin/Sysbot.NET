# Sword/Shield: Unlimited Egg Mode

The Unlimited Egg Mode for Pokémon Sword and Shield automates the breeding process. It will continuously breed Pokémon until an egg matches a specified `StopCondition`. The bot will keep running as long as there are parent Pokémon in the designated folder.

## Setup for Unlimited Egg Mode

1.  **Party**: Fill your in-game party with any Pokémon (their species do not matter for this initial setup).
2.  **SysBot.NET Settings**:
    *   Change the `ContinueAfterMatch` setting to `Continue`.
    *   Set `UnlimitedMode` to `true`.
    *   Specify the path to your folder containing parent Pokémon in `UnlimitedParentsFolder`.
3.  **In-Game Position**: Stand next to the Day-Care Lady on Route 5.
4.  **Day-Care**: Place a Ditto in the Day-Care. Using a foreign Ditto is recommended if you are aiming for Shiny eggs (Masuda method).
5.  **Start Bot**: Start the bot. It will begin by taking the first parent Pokémon from your `UnlimitedParentsFolder` and placing it into the Day-Care with the Ditto.

## Mass Egg Hatching

To hatch eggs in bulk:

1.  **Routine**: Keep the bot's routine set to `EggFetch`.
2.  **Encounter Type**: Change the `EncounteringType` setting to `EggHatch`.
3.  **Operation**: SysBot.NET will continuously cycle Pokémon in your party to hatch eggs. Your only task is to ensure your party remains filled with eggs.
