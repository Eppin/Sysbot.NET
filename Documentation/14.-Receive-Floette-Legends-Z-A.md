# Legends: Z-A: Receive Floette

This guide covers receiving Floette from Taunie at the Quasartico building until a `StopCondition` is met (e.g., specific IVs, etc.).

## Prerequisites

- Complete the 15th promotion battle
- Have access to the Quasartico building

## Setup Options

### Option 1: Full Boxes Method
1. Fill all PC boxes completely
2. Enter the Quasartico building
3. Taunie will say you have no space for Pokémon
4. Exit the building and position yourself facing the door
5. Ensure the "Press A to enter" prompt appears
6. Clear/release slot 1 of box 1 (B1S1)
7. **Save your game**
8. Start the bot

### Option 2: Standard Method
1. Stand directly in front of the Quasartico building entrance
2. Face the door until you see "Press A to enter"
3. Make sure slot 1 of box 1 (B1S1) is empty
4. **Save your game**
5. Start the bot

## How It Works

The bot will:
1. Enter the building
2. Talk to Taunie to receive Floette
3. Check if the received Floette matches your stop conditions
4. If not, reset and repeat the process

Since Floette is available in B1S1 before the auto-save is triggered, this routine can run without any cheats needed.

## Tips

- Make sure you're positioned correctly before starting
- The bot works best when the "Press A to enter" prompt is clearly visible
- Use stop conditions to target specific Floette (shiny, nature, IVs, etc.)
