# Sword/Shield: Encounter Bot Guide (Calyrex and Spectrier/Glastrier)

This guide explains how to use the encounter bot for Calyrex and its steeds (Spectrier or Glastrier) in Pokémon Sword and Shield. The bot can optionally use a 100% capture rate cheat (original source: [GBAtemp](https://gbatemp.net/threads/pokemon-sword-shield-v1-3-1-cfw-emu-cheat-codes.579372/post-9782611)). After a successful capture, the bot will end the dialogue and read the horse's data to check if the encounter matches your defined stop conditions.

## In-Game Settings Prerequisites

Before starting, please configure the following options in your game:
-   'Autosave': **Off**
-   'Send to Boxes': **Automatic** (Recommended: Have a full party to ensure the caught Pokémon goes directly to a box. If your party is not full, the Pokémon will be added to your party first.)
-   'Give Nicknames': **Off**

## Game Setup Instructions

1.  **Poké Balls**:
    *   **Option 1 (Master Ball)**: Ensure you have only the **Master Ball** in your bag's Poké Ball pocket.
    *   **Option 2 (100% Capture Cheat)**: Enable the 100% capture rate cheat. You can then use any Poké Ball type you prefer. To ensure the bot selects your desired ball, mark it as a favorite and sort your Poké Ball pocket by favorites. This will make your chosen ball appear first during the battle.
2.  **Save Position**: Save your game directly in front of the Calyrex encounter (at the point where you interact to start the battle for either Spectrier or Glastrier).
3.  **Start the Bot**: Launch SysBot.NET and start the encounter bot.
