# Scarlet/Violet: Encounter Bot Guide (Pecharunt)

This guide explains how to use the encounter bot for Pecharunt in Pokémon Scarlet/Violet.

## Core Strategy

The routine aims to One-Hit KO (OHKO) Pecharunt, or at least defeat it before it can KO any of your Pokémon. If successful, the encounter becomes a simple process of repeatedly pressing the A-button.

**Important Note**: For this routine, you can only have one type of Poké Ball in your bag's Poké Ball pocket.

## Recommended Pokémon for OHKO

-   **Mewtwo**:
    -   Nature: Modest
    -   Held Item: Choice Specs
    -   EVs: 252 SpA
    -   First Move: **Psychic**

_If you have other Pokémon that work reliably, please let me know to add them here!_

## In-Game Settings Prerequisites

Before starting, please configure the following options in your game:
-   'Autosave': **Off**
-   'Send to Boxes': **Automatic**
-   'Give Nicknames': **Off**

## Setup and Bot Operation

1.  **Save Game**: Save your game while standing directly in front of Pecharunt.
2.  **Party and Box Setup**:
    *   Ensure your party is full.
    *   Place your OHKO Pokémon (e.g., Mewtwo) in the first slot of your party.
    *   Ensure Box 1, Slot 1 (B1S1) in your PC is empty, as this is where Pecharunt will be sent if caught.
3.  **Start the Bot**: Launch SysBot.NET and start the encounter bot.

## Important Note on Pecharunt's Nature

Pecharunt will **ALWAYS** have a Timid nature. Ensure your bot's stop conditions do not filter for any other natures.
