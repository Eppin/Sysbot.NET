# Scarlet/Violet: Encounter Bot Guide (Bloodmoon Ursaluna)

This guide explains how to use the encounter bot for the Bloodmoon Ursaluna in Pokémon Scarlet/Violet.

## Core Strategy

The routine aims to One-Hit KO (OHKO) Ursaluna, or at least defeat it before it can KO any of your Pokémon. If successful, the encounter becomes a simple process of repeatedly pressing the A-button.

**Important Note**: For this routine, you can only have one type of Poké Ball in your bag's Poké Ball pocket.

## Recommended Pokémon for OHKO

-   **Kyogre**:
    -   Nature: Modest
    -   Held Item: Choice Specs
    -   EVs: 252 SpA / 252 Spe / 6 Def
    -   First Move: **Water Spout**

_If you have other Pokémon that work reliably, please let me know to add them here!_

## In-Game Settings Prerequisites

Before starting, please configure the following options in your game:
-   'Autosave': **Off**
-   'Send to Boxes': **Automatic**
-   'Give Nicknames': **Off**

## Setup and Bot Operation

1.  **Quest Progression**: Start the Bloodmoon Ursaluna quest and take the required 10 photos of Pokémon in the Timeless Woods.
2.  **Decline Battle**: When Perrin asks if you are ready to face Ursaluna, select **No**.
3.  **Save Game**: Save your game while standing directly in front of Perrin.
4.  **Party and Box Setup**:
    *   Ensure your party is full.
    *   Place your OHKO Pokémon (e.g., Kyogre) in the first slot of your party.
    *   Ensure Box 1, Slot 1 (B1S1) in your PC is empty, as this is where Ursaluna will be sent if caught.
5.  **Start the Bot**: Launch SysBot.NET and start the encounter bot.

## Important Note on Ursaluna's Nature

Bloodmoon Ursaluna will **ALWAYS** have a Hardy nature. Ensure your bot's stop conditions do not filter for any other natures.
