# Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl: Eggs (Including Unlimited Egg Mode)

This guide covers egg breeding in Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, including the Unlimited Egg Mode. This mode automates breeding until an egg matches a `StopCondition` and continues as long as parent Pokémon are available in the specified folder.

## Setup for Unlimited Egg Mode

1.  **Party**: Fill your in-game party with any Pokémon.
2.  **SysBot.NET Settings**:
    *   Set `ContinueAfterMatch` to `Continue`.
    *   Set `UnlimitedMode` to `true`.
    *   Provide the folder path for parent Pokémon in `UnlimitedParentsFolder`.
3.  **In-Game Position**: Stand next to the Day-Care Man in Solaceon Town.
4.  **Day-Care**: Place a Ditto in the Day-Care. For Shiny hunting, use a foreign Ditto (Masuda method).
5.  **In-Game Options**:
    *   Ensure `Text Speed` is set to `Fast`.
    *   Ensure `Send to Boxes` is set to `Automatic`.
6.  **Start Bot**: Start the bot. It will take the first parent from `UnlimitedParentsFolder` and deposit it into Day-Care.

**Important Note**: All hatched Pokémon will be sent to Box 1, Slot 1 (B1S1). To save these Pokémon, ensure the `Dump` setting is enabled in SysBot.NET's Folder settings (this corresponds to the [`SysBot.Pokemon.FolderSettings.Dump`](SysBot.Pokemon/Settings/FolderSettings.cs) property).

## Mass Egg Hatching

To hatch eggs in bulk:

1.  **Routine**: Keep the bot's routine set to `EggFetch`.
2.  **Encounter Type**: Change the `EncounteringType` setting to `EggHatch`.
3.  **Operation**: SysBot.NET will continuously cycle Pokémon in your party to hatch eggs. You need to keep your party supplied with eggs.
