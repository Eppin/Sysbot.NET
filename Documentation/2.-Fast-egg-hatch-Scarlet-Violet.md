# Scarlet/Violet: Fast Egg Hatch Guide

This guide explains how to use the fast egg hatch bot for Pokémon Scarlet/Violet, which can fetch eggs at a speed of approximately 1,800 eggs per hour.

## Prerequisites: Applying the Mod

Before using the fast egg hatch bot, you need to apply a mod.

1.  Download the mod from the [Extra](https://github.com/Eppin/Sysbot.NET/tree/main/Resources/Instant%20egg) folder.
2.  Extract the downloaded `.zip` file.
3.  Place the two extracted folders into your `atmosphere/contents/` directory on your SD card. The directory structure should look like this:
    *   `atmosphere/contents/0100A3D008C5C000/...`
    *   `atmosphere/contents/01008F6008C5E000/...`

## In-Game Setup and Bot Operation

1.  **Start a Picnic**: In Pokémon Scarlet or Violet, initiate a picnic.
2.  **Positioning**: Stand your character near the egg basket.
3.  **Start the Bot**: Launch SysBot.NET and start the fast egg hatch bot.
4.  **Post-Match Behavior**:
    *   If the bot is set to the 'Stop' condition, it will halt after finding a matching egg.
    *   Otherwise (e.g., 'Continue' condition), it will place the next egg in the subsequent box space (B1S2, B1S3, and so on).
5.  **Saving Progress**: After the bot stops or you decide to end the process, **make sure to exit the picnic and save your game manually!**
